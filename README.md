# fullstack-ab-testing
Cloudflare Summer 2020 Internship Coding Challenge

Deployed demo: https://cloudflare-fullstack-app.andrewshieh.workers.dev/

This project uses the Cloudflare Workers API to route users to one of two variants of a site (ostensibly for A/B
testing) returned from a fetched URL with equal probability. Also implements the first two extra credit features:
changing copy/URLs and persisting variants via cookies.

The variants differ in their button color: one has a green button, the other has a blue button.
